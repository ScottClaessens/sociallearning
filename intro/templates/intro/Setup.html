<p>
    In the coming session you own an imaginary farm. You will run this farm in <b>4 different
    experiments</b> in which you can earn points. At the end of the session, these points will be translated
    into real money (1000 points = 1 euro).
</p>
<p>
    At the beginning of each experiment, you will be grouped with 7 randomly chosen other
    participants in the room and each is randomly labeled with a number 1-8. All experiments
    are <b>anonymous</b>; you cannot find out the real identity of the other Farmers in
    your group, and they cannot find this out about you. During each experiment, your group consists
    of the same 8 participants, but when a new experiment starts, new groups are formed. At the
    beginning of each experiment, you will receive 2500 points to start with. The experiments are
    completely separate â€“ what you earn in one experiment does not influence what you can earn in the
    other experiments. Also, it is likely that your earnings will vary between experiments.
